This workshop will be using Jupyter Notebook for the lesson materials and notes. It is recommended to install Anaconda, which includes the Jupyter Notebook IDE and other Python libraries, before coming to the workshop.

### 1. Install Anaconda
You can download the latest version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

### 2. Download lesson materials
Clone or download this [Github repository](https://github.com/theresa-leehq/text-analysis-in-python), so that you have access to the Jupyter Notebooks and data. Click the green button that says ``<> Code`` and clone it if you are familiar with Github, or click **Download ZIP** to save it to your computer.

### 3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook from there. A browser window will open. Navigate to the file *Text Analysis in Python.ipynb* and open it.
